A grid-connected photovoltaic power system will reduce the power bill due to the import and export of power through net metering provision. Illustration: someone imports (consumes) 1,000 kWh from the grid and exports 600 kWh to the grid in a billing cycle. The energy bill will be for 400 kWh (1000 kWh – 600 kWh) accounted by Netmeter. Grid-connected PV systems do not require batteries. Batteries are costly require periodic maintenance and also lead to the wastage of 15 – 20 % of energy in storage and retrieval. Grid-connected PV systems are much easier to operate and maintain. Segregation of load is not required."

The main focus of GOBARDHAN is to keep villages clean, increase the income of rural households, and generate energy and organic manure from cattle waste. As rural India has already attained the Open Defecation Free (ODF) status, the importance of GOBARDHAN has increased as it supports the villages in achieving ODF-plus status, which is an important objective of Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) Phase II. ﻿ GOBARDHAN: Waste to Wealth program has been designed to provide a common platform for schemes of different Ministries/Departments such as the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE); Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG); Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying (DAHD); Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DACFW); Department of Rural Development; and Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation (DDWS). DDWS is the coordinating Department for the implementation of the scheme.

The main objectives of this scheme are: The solar pumps assist our farmers in much more effective and eco-friendly irrigation as these are capable of generating safer energy. In addition, the pump sets comprise an energy power grid that generates more energy than diesel-driven pumps. Farmers will be able to sell the extra power to our Government directly to enhance their income. ﻿ KUSUM Scheme comprises 3 components that have different features: Component A: Install a total of 10GV grid-connected stilt-mounted decentralized solar plants and other renewable energy-based power plants. Each plant is sized up to 500KW to 2MV. Component B: Install stand-alone solar pumps of up to 7.5HP individual capacity and worth 17.50 lakh. Component C: Provide financial support to Solaris 10 lakh grid-connected agricultural pumps of 7.5HP of capacity each.",

A landholder in a rural area can get a stable source of income by utilizing barren and uncultivated land for solar plant implementation for 25 years. The solar plants will be set up above a minimum height in cultivable lands. This way, our farmers will be able to continue with cultivation after installing the plants.

The scheme was launched on 1st May 2016 in Ballia, Uttar Pradesh by Hon’ble Prime Minister of India, Shri. Narendra Modi ﻿ The target under the scheme was to release 8 Crore LPG Connections to the deprived households by March 2020. On 7th September 2019, Hon’ble Prime Minister of India handed over the 8th Crore LPG connection in Aurangabad, Maharashtra. The release of 8 Crore LPG connections under the scheme has also helped in increasing the LPG coverage from 62% on 1st May 2016 to 99.8% as on 1st April 2021. Under the Union Budget for FY 21-22, provision for release of additional 1 Crore LPG connections under the PMUY scheme has been made. In this phase, special facility has been given to migrant families. ﻿ ﻿",
