This scheme was launched under Kerala Social Security Mission. Those patients found eligible would be registered under the scheme and a Patient Card would be issued. Registered patients would be provided treatment free of cost at the designated hospitals. On further verification, if it is found that any registered patient is ineligible for assistance, the assistance would be stopped forthwith. Cancer, the killer disease, was once considered incurable. However, advances in medical science have helped conquer the disease to a very large extent. It is scientifically proven that pediatric cases of cancer are largely curable if treated early. Recognizing the urgent need to extend financial support to cancer victims from families, who are too poor to afford treatment, the Government of Kerala launched this scheme. To provide cashless transactions funds have already been deposited with the superintendents of the hospitals. The patients who are eligible for assistance would receive the benefit from these hospitals directly without approaching the Mission.

        "Offline Step 1: Identification and Registration of Beneficiary An Accredited Social Health Activist, Auxiliary Nurse Midwife, Anganwadi Worker, or any designated link worker will identify and register the pregnant woman as a beneficiary of the scheme",
        "This crucial step should be completed at least 20 to 24 weeks before the expected date of delivery to ensure timely access to benefits and services",
        "Step 2: Maternal and Child Health Card Filling Immediately upon successful registration, the Auxiliary Nurse Midwife, Accredited Social Health Activist, Anganwadi Worker, or an equivalent link worker will accurately complete a Maternal and Child Health card",
        "This card is issued in duplicate, with one copy provided to the mother and the other retained by the link worker, forming an essential part of the Janani Suraksha Yojana registration",
        "Step 3: Antenatal Care Information and Planning The designated link worker will inform the applicant about the schedule for at least three antenatal care check-ups and the required Tetanus Toxoid injections, ensuring these services are provided",
        "Furthermore, they will clearly identify and communicate the health center for all necessary referrals and the predetermined place of delivery, along with the expected date of delivery",
        "The Accredited Social Health Activist is responsible for following up on antenatal care visits at Anganwadi Centres or Sub-centers to ensure the beneficiary's attendance",
        "Step 4: Collection of Necessary Proofs/Certificates If required by the specific eligibility criteria, the Accredited Social Health Activist, Auxiliary Nurse Midwife, Anganwadi Worker, or a link worker will assist the applicant in collecting the necessary Below Poverty Line or other relevant proofs and certificates from the local Panchayat, local bodies, or Municipalities",
        "This step should be completed within two to four weeks from the initial registration date",
        "Step 5: Submission for Verification and Fund Arrangement The completed Janani Suraksha Yojana card is to be submitted to the Medical Officer of the Primary Health Centre for verification",
        "Concurrently, proactive steps are undertaken to arrange transport or ensure the availability of cash for the beneficiary to reach the health center for delivery or in case of complications",
        "It is also ensured that adequate funds are available with the Auxiliary Nurse Midwife, health worker, or Accredited Social Health Activist for the prompt disbursement of benefits",
        "﻿ General Steps for Receiving the Benefits Step 1: Accessing Health Centre for Delivery The pregnant woman, ideally accompanied by an Accredited Social Health Activist or another designated link worker, will proceed to the pre-determined government or accredited private health institution for delivery",
        "The Accredited Social Health Activist is expected to stay with the woman until her discharge from the facility",
        "Step 2: Cash Benefit Disbursement at Institution Upon arrival and registration for delivery at the health center, the mother and, if applicable, the Accredited Social Health Activist, should receive their entitled cash benefit immediately",
        "The Auxiliary Nurse Midwife or Accredited Social Health Activist (or another identified link worker operating under the Auxiliary Nurse Midwife's guidance) will typically manage this disbursement process",
        "For deliveries occurring in accredited private institutions, the cash benefit is disbursed to the mother via the Auxiliary Nurse Midwife/Accredited Social Health Activist/link worker channel",
        "In some hospital settings, a voucher scheme may be implemented, where an admission slip for delivery, combined with a voucher for the mother’s package and transport assistance, is provided for encashment at the hospital’s cash counter upon discharge",
        "All payments before or after seven days of delivery are treated as illegitimate subject to audit objection",
        "Step 3: Postnatal Care and Immunization The Accredited Social Health Activist is mandated to conduct a postnatal visit within seven days following delivery to monitor the mother's health and to facilitate the newborn's immunization, specifically for Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG)",
        "This postnatal visit and the child's immunization are prerequisites for the Accredited Social Health Activist to receive her second payment installment",
        "Step 4: Sterilization Compensation (if applicable) Should the mother or her husband voluntarily choose to undergo sterilization immediately after the child's delivery, the compensation money designated under the existing Family Welfare scheme will be disbursed directly to the mother at the hospital premises",
        "﻿ Application Deadlines Timely registration for antenatal care, ideally 20-24 weeks before the expected date of delivery",
        "Additionally, cash benefits for home delivery should be disbursed at the time of delivery or approximately 7 days prior",
        "Payments made outside of a seven-day window around delivery are subject to audit objections",
        "Where to Apply Registration for the scheme and access to services are facilitated through government health centers, including Sub-centers, Primary Health Centres, Community Health Centres, First Referral Units, and District and State Hospitals",
        "Services may also be availed at accredited private institutions",
        "Key contact points at the community level for guidance and assistance are Accredited Social Health Activists, Auxiliary Nurse Midwives, and Anganwadi Workers",
        "Application Status Tracking To ensure transparency and allow beneficiaries to track their status, a list of Janani Suraksha Yojana beneficiaries, detailing the date of cash disbursement, must be prominently displayed on notice boards at all Sub-centers, Primary Health Centres, Community Health Centres, and District Hospitals",
        "This list is required to be updated regularly on a monthly basis",
        "Help & Support / Grievance Redressal Each district is mandated to establish a dedicated grievance redressal cell under the District Project Management Unit",

        "Crucially, comprehensive information about this grievance cell, including the officer's name, postal address, and telephone number, must be prominently displayed at all health centers and institutions to ensure easy access for beneficiaries"

      "detailed_description": "Details The scheme \"Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP)\" was launched by the Department of Pharmaceuticals, Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers, in November 2008. The branded (Generic) medicines are sold at significantly higher prices than their un-branded generic equivalents, though are identical in therapeutic value. Given the widespread poverty across the country, making available reasonably priced quality generic medicines in the market would benefit everyone. Objectives: To make quality generic medicines available at affordable prices to all, Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) was launched by the Department of Pharmaceuticals, Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers, Government of India in November 2008. Under the scheme, dedicated outlets known as Janaushadhi Kendras are opened to provide generic medicines at affordable prices. As of 30.11.2023, 10,000 Janaushadhi Kendras are functional nationwide. The product basket of PMBJP comprises 1965 drugs and 293 surgical items. The scheme is implemented by a society registered under the Societies Registration Act, viz., Pharma & Medical Bureau of India (PMBI), [erstwhile Bureau of Pharma PSUs of India (BPPI)]. Ensure access to quality medicines for all sections of the population, especially the poor and the deprived ones. Create awareness about generic medicines through education and publicity to counter the perception that quality is synonymous with high prices only. Generate employment by engaging individual entrepreneurs in the opening of the PMBJP Kendra.",
