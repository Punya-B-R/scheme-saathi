Projects constructed in Backward Talukas OR owned by Women Entrepreneurs/Entrepreneurs belonging to Schedule Caste/Schedule Tribe Communities are eligible for 05 consecutive years from the date the loan was taken. ﻿ Subsidy Computation and Disbursal The subsidy calculation will take into account the interest amount paid up to the end of the previous fiscal year, for the claim submitted for the year or part of the year. The subsidy calculation will be based on the actual interest amount incurred, as determined by the prevailing interest rate applicable to the concerned financial transaction. The reimbursement shall not include penal interest, liquidated damages, or similar charges paid to the financial institutions/banks. ﻿ Claim Submission If an Entity fails to file the annual claim after the first year, it may still submit the delayed claim in the following year, provided it falls within the overall subsidy eligibility period specified in Table 7.1. If interest cannot be claimed due to non-payment before filing, the unit shall be eligible to claim such interest subject to payment of the same in the subsequent year. ﻿ Loan Compliance In case of default in payment of term loan (i.e., not paid as per schedule of repayment) reimbursement of interest shall be reduced to the extent of default. Only the limit of original loan granted and not rescheduled loan shall be considered for interest reimbursement. In case an Entity procures loans from multiple financial institutions, the aggregate sum of interest paid across these loans shall qualify for subsidy consideration, provided the total claimed does not surpass the prescribed maximum allowable amount. In case of more than one unit with a consolidated balance sheet, a certificate from a Chartered Accountant giving interest details unit-wise shall be submitted by the applicant, and the claim shall be made only for the eligible unit. ﻿"

To augment the income of the rural people where poultry farming along with livestock rearing is being carried on as a mixed farming complementary to crop production. Doubling of income of farmers.

      "detailed_description": "Details The Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) launched the National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS) on 19th August 2016 to provide financial incentives to the establishments engaging apprentice under the Apprentices Act, 1961. National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme-2 (NAPS-2) aims to promote apprenticeship training in the country, by providing partial stipend support to the apprentices engaged under the Apprentice Act, 1961, undertaking capacity building of the apprenticeship ecosystem, and providing advocacy assistance to the stakeholders. It aims at improving ease of doing business by simplifying processes of apprenticeship engagement. NAPS-2 is a Central Sector Scheme (100% funded by the Central Government) and is one of the sub-components under the umbrella scheme of \" Skill India Programme ‟. The Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) is responsible for the overall regulation, management, and monitoring of NAPS-2. Objectives of the NAPS-2 scheme:- To develop skilled workforce for the economy by promotion of on-the-job experiential training. To encourage establishments to enroll apprentices by sharing partial stipend support to the apprentices. To provide up-skilling opportunities for candidates who have undergone short-term skill training offered by various Central and State Government initiatives. To encourage enrolment of apprentices in small establishments especially Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), and those located in the underserved areas such as aspirational districts and North-East Region. Anticipated outcome of the scheme:- MSDE aims to train 46 lakh apprentices from FY2022-23 to FY2025-26. The scheme envisages greater promotion of apprenticeship in India and assisting stakeholders through various measures for accelerating the performance of Approved apprenticeship. Other important key facts:- To enhance and track the conversion of apprentices to employment, apprentices, on successful completion of their training, will be provided with a provision of quick registration on the National Career Service (NCS) portal of Ministry of Labour and Employment. To boost apprenticeship engagement in the ever-growing infrastructure sector, NAPS-2 will be linked to flagship Government infrastructure programs via platforms such as Gati Shakti. Innovative models to preserve and upgrade existing apprenticeship systems in the informal economy, with a focus on craftsman, artisans, traditional skills, etc., will be taken up under NAPS-2.",

The scheme has been approved for continuation over the 15th Finance Commission cycle i.e., for the period of five years from 2021-22 to 2025-26. PMEGP was formed by merging the two schemes that were in operation till 31st March 2008, namely Prime Minister's Rojgar Yojana (PMRY) and Rural Employment Generation Programme (REGP). An outlay of ₹13,554.42 Crore has been approved for PMEGP for five Financial Years (2021-22 to 2025-26) to set up about 4,00,000 projects with the creation of 30,00,000 employment @8 persons per unit). In addition, 1,000 Units will be upgraded in each FY. Objectives To generate employment opportunities in rural as well as urban areas of the country through the setting up of new self-employment ventures/projects/micro enterprises. To bring together widely dispersed traditional artisans! rural and urban unemployed youth and give them self-employment opportunities to the extent possible, at their place.

Such projects will be approved by PMKVY 3.0 Executive CommitteeDuring PMKVY 2.0, states were also permitted to utilise 15% of their targets towards Special Projects.

The scheme’s mandate is to promote and encourage young students for embracing translational research to develop innovative products and technologies addressing unmet needs. The scheme has two components: SITARE-Gandhian Young Technological Innovation Award Grant (SITARE-GYTI) and SITARE-Appreciation Grant. SITARE-Gandhian Young Technological Innovation Award Grant (SITARE-GYTI): Under the SITARE-GYTI scheme component, 15 innovative student projects will receive funding support of up to INR 15 lakhs each. The scheme encourages postgraduate and doctoral students to undertake projects with commercial potential leading to the creation of biotech startups. The fund recipients are recognized as BIRAC’s SITARE-GYTI beneficiaries. “SITARE-GYTI” Award Grant is not a usual research fellowship. Nature of Proposals supported: Translational research proposals to develop innovative products and technologies with the potential to address unmet needs. The work supported through the SITARE-GYTI Award Grant is expected to lead to the creation of biotech startups. Hence, only proposals with the potential to commercialize innovative products and technologies will be considered for support. Areas covered: SITARE-GYTI award grant proposals can be submitted in any domain including Healthcare, Lifesciences, Diagnostics, Medical Devices, Drugs, Vaccines, Drug Formulations and delivery systems, Industrial Biotechnology, Bioinformatics, Agriculture, Secondary agriculture, Waste Management, Sanitation, Clean Energy and Artificial Intelligence/IoT with application in any of these areas. BIRAC encourages interdisciplinary proposals from any stream that can help the conversion of innovative ideas into biotech products and technologies in any of the above fields. Duration of project: The funding is provided for a period of up to 24 months. The project is implemented in a milestone-based manner. In case the grant award duration extends beyond the degree programme, the grantee is encouraged to incubate in any of the bio incubators for completing the SITARE-GYTI award grant mandate. Extension: Extension of grant award duration is discouraged. Request for extension of milestone/project can be considered (without any additional financial implications) only in selected cases based on the recommendation of the SITARE-GYTI Review Committee conducted by SITARE Partner/BIRAC. However, such a request with proper justification must reach SITARE Partner/BIRAC well before the scheduled date of completion of the grant award period.",
