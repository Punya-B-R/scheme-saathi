      "detailed_description": "Details The Chief Minister's Krishi Rinn Yojana (CMKRY) is a scheme initiated by the Government of Arunachal Pradesh to support farmers by providing them with zero-interest crop loans. Under this scheme, the government offers an interest subvention of 4% on crop loans or Kisan Credit Card limits up to Rs. 3.00 lakhs, sanctioned by all banks during the current financial year. This interest subvention is provided over and above the subvention given by the Government of India to banks and farmers per the policy circular issued by RBI/NABARD. Additionally, farmers who promptly repay their short-term production credit (crop loan) within one year of disbursement or withdrawal can avail themselves of an interest relief of 3% per annum. In other words, farmers who take loans up to Rs. 3.00 lakhs and make timely repayments are eligible for the zero-interest credit facility. NABARD acts as the channel partner for reimbursement to banks regarding the interest subvention amount of this scheme. The state government also issues a notification wherein a certificate of the cultivated area and crops being grown is issued by the Circle Officer, which is considered a valid document by banks for issuing Kisan Credit Cards to farmers. Salient Features: The farmer will get interest subvention of 4% on crop loan / KCC limit upto Rs. 3 lakh. The farmers can take loans from any bank within the state during the current financial year. If the farmer make their loan payment on time they will also get interest relief of 3% per annum on their crop loan. The government will not provide any relief for the production of perennial food crop and plantation crop. The farmers will be selected separately through district and concerned bank wise. Objective of this scheme: To provide a facility of crop loans at zero interest rates for farmers in the state.",

The scheme will have the following components: Provide for interest subvention or subsidy for credit extended by banks to new borrowers under the category of Self-Help Groups, Farmer Producer Organizations, and Individuals for identified activities. Provide for additional interest subvention, over and above what is already provided in existing central government schemes, to make credit more attractive and affordable. Provide collateral-free credit access to Entrepreneurs for Micro and Small Enterprises. Beneficiaries seeking non-subsidy linked loans and fresh beneficiaries seeking subsidy-linked loans. Objectives of the Scheme: To increase farmers' income by increasing investment in the sector, quality inputs, and technology. To promote investment in Agri & Allied and in the small enterprise sectors. To promote credit discipline and encourage the Banking Sector to support Agricultural and small enterprise sectors in the State. To improve the Agri-marketing network and infrastructure in the State. To promote private enterprise. To provide collateral-free credit access to aspiring entrepreneurs. Scheme Implementing Agencies: 1. At the State HQ Level • Nodal Department shall be the Finance Department. • Department of Agriculture, Horticulture, Veterinary and Animal Husbandry, Fisheries, Industries & Commerce, Nagaland State Rural Livelihood Mission, and Investment & Development Authority of Nagaland shall provide the necessary technical support. 2.

Salient Features of the Scheme: The proposed Scheme is a bank credit-linked subsidy scheme to be implemented in a time-bound manner with participation from various stakeholders - government, bankers, farmers, and entrepreneurs. Broad features of the scheme are: All banks, including the Nagaland Cooperative Banks, will be eligible and shall be encouraged to participate in the Scheme. There will be a district-wise allocation, which will be decided by a State Level Committee headed by the Chief Secretary. This will help avoid skewed distribution of projects regionally. Equal emphasis will be given to all projects, with focus on bankability rather than a particular trade/activity. The borrowers under the scheme will be monitored at the district level by an Implementation Committee headed by the Deputy Commissioner, with members drawn from the various departments. Extension of support to the beneficiaries will be provided by the respective departments. The scheme will involve active participation of the banks and the district machinery to transfer the benefits of the subsidy assistance while creating sustainable livelihoods. The application will be scrutinized by the concerned Bank Branch, and where required, the technical inputs from Nodal Department may be sought for finalizing the beneficiaries seeking capital-subsidy, that too only in cases where loan amount is above 10 Lakhs. For all other categories of beneficiaries, banks shall do the due diligence. The banks shall disburse the entire approved loan and subsidy. The subsidy shall be back-ended and disbursed through the banks. The controlling office or the nodal bank of the financing bank shall submit the claims immediately after release of the first installment of the loan. The details of the eligibility criteria, pattern of assistance, the procedures to be adopted, and the framework of guidelines for implementing the scheme shall be as laid down in this scheme.",

Applicability: The CPIS will be applicable to all healthy nuts bearing coconut palms; grown as mono or intercropped; on bunds farms or homestead and to all varieties of coconut, including Tall, Dwarf and Hybrids. Since, Dwarf and Hybrids begin to yield fruit from 4th year of planting, this variety of coconut palms in age range of 4-60 year will be covered under the scheme, but Tall variety coconut palms will be eligible for coverage for age range of 7-60 year. Unhealthy and senile palms will be excluded from coverage. Risks covered: The scheme covers following perils leading to death/loss of palm or palm becoming un-productive: Storm, hailstorm, cyclone typhoon, tornado, heavy rains. Flood and inundation. Pest and diseases of widespread nature causing, irreparable damages to palm. Accidental fire, including forest fire and bush fire, lightening. Earthquake, landslide and tsunami.

The scheme aims to assist government employees in achieving their dream of owning a house by providing financial support to erstwhile House Building Advance scheme beneficiaries whose loans were operative as on 15th May 2020. The scheme provides loan takeover facility through empanelled banks with shared interest payment mechanism where the employee bears 2% of the interest plus the principal component while the Government bears the remainder of the interest subject to a maximum of 5%. The scheme is implemented by the Directorate of Accounts in coordination with empanelled banks notified separately by the Government. The applications for this scheme are accepted offline. ﻿",

The loan takeover facility is provided for the amount outstanding as on the date of application after repayment of instalments from May 2020. For employees who had availed additional loan over and above the House Building Advance amount, the Government's share of interest is restricted only to the extent of such House Building Advance loan outstanding as on the date of application. Disbursement The Government's share of interest is credited to the empanelled bank in a pool account on a monthly basis. The Government's cumulative share of all instalments due for the succeeding month is credited to the bank within a specified date, provided that the bank raises the demand at least 20 days in advance. The Government's share commences from the succeeding month of sanction wherein the employee is due for repayment of the loan, provided the demand has been raised by the bank. Duration and Validity The Government's share is continued till the employee attains superannuation or for a maximum duration of 20 years of the total repayment period, whichever is earlier, by considering the already paid instalments by the Government. If the duration of the loan ends before superannuation of the employee, the bank submits the closure letter to the concerned Government employee, Head of Department and Directorate of Accounts. Conditions The employee must ensure that his share of Equated Monthly Instalment reaches the bank within the stipulated time. Any delay on part of the employee for contributing his share, subject to a maximum default duration of two months, will make the concerned employee ineligible to avail any further benefits under this scheme. The employee must carry out all the required documentation and valuation required for compliance from the bank side, and the Government will not bear any costs for the same. The deed of mortgage or any other collateral security executed in favour of Government earlier must be transferred in favour of the empanelled bank with an undertaking from the employee that he willingly desires to transfer the same in favour of the bank. For employees who have availed benefits under the \"One Time House Building Advance Settlement Scheme\", the amount to the extent of benefits availed under that scheme would be adjusted in the initial instalments itself, till which the Government will not start contributing its share of interest and the employee has to bear the full burden of instalments. If the employee ceases to be in service for any reason other than normal retirement or superannuation or if he dies before repayment of the loan in full, the entire outstanding amount will become payable forthwith by the Government employee or his successor, as the case may be. Failure to repay the housing loan for any reason whatsoever, either by the Government employee or the successor, as the case may be, will entitle the bank to enforce the mortgage and take action to recover the outstanding housing loan. ﻿"

A candidate seeking to undergo Commercial Pilot License Training must have passed Matriculation or Higher Secondary School Certificate or its equivalent examination and must possess all the academic and technical qualifications required by the institute in which the candidate intends to undergo training for admission to the Commercial Pilot License Training Course. The country/abroad institution providing such training should have obtained the conditions laid down for the admission of the trainee and all the necessary documents for such training such as a medical certificate, fitness certificate, etc. The institute in which the trainee receives his training abroad must be approved by the government of his country for imparting such training and the commercial pilot license obtained after such training must be accepted in that country, after which the trainee must undergo a legal process of one year to get that license accepted in India. The assistance will be sanctioned only after receiving the consent letter from the training institute for admission of the candidate; the trainee will have to submit the cost estimates for his training obtained from that institute. If any of the relatives of the candidate desiring to undergo such training are living abroad, the trainees should not be sponsored for financial responsibility by them. The applicant shall be free to repay the due amount earlier than the due date. If the applicant uses this loan for any other purpose, the loan amount will be recovered from the date of repayment (together with penal interest). The beneficiary has to furnish two valid sureties. Note 01: After completion of training the beneficiary will have to render his services in India for a minimum period of five years. If they settle abroad, the entire amount of such assistance will have to be returned to the Government of Gujarat with interest. There will be no relaxation in this. Note 02: The amount provided under this scheme will be limited to the amount actually required for training. The amount for training in India will include tuition fees and other incidental expenses. The decision of the Director, Scheduled Caste Welfare in this matter shall be final. Note 03: The amount of assistance will be paid at the rate of exchange fixed by the Reserve Bank of India while disbursing the amount under this scheme to the trainees who wish to undergo training abroad. And the allowances of the trainees will also have to be approved by the Reserve Bank. Loans can be sanctioned to the extent that the Reserve Bank approves tuition fees, subsistence allowance (for a maximum of six months), and allowance for start-up equipment. Note 04: The trainee should actually start the training within one month from the date of disbursement of the loan amount. The training should be obtained from the institution and also a quarterly report by the trainee on the progress of his training submitted to the Director, Scheduled Caste Welfare, Gandhinagar, Gujarat. Note 05: If the applicant defaults in regular repayment of the loan sanctioned, a penal interest at the rate of 2.5% per annum will be charged against the outstanding installments. In case of default in payment of penalty installments, all costs and other costs of recovery of the sheet as well as the balance will be recovered from the Revenue together. Note 06: Loan recovery will be started after one year from the date of disbursement of the loan to the beneficiary. The beneficiary will have to pay back the loan in 10 years with principal and interest in 2 years, total amount including interest in 12 years. Accordingly, the monthly installment amount will be calculated and recovered."

Since, 2005-06 this scheme has been implemented by the Handlooms, Textiles & Handicrafts Department of the Government of Odisha with the revised title “ Mahatma Gandhi Bunkar Yojana ”. The basic objective is: to provide enhanced insurance coverage to the handloom weavers in the case of natural as well as accidental death and in cases of total or partial disability. The concerned handloom authority in the state will finalize the insurance coverage, as the Life Insurance Corporation of India administers the scheme. The State Governments and the State Handloom Corporations/Apex/Primary Handloom Weavers Cooperative Societies/Unions/ Associations shall be actively associated in the implementation of the scheme by way of sensitizing the handloom weavers to join the scheme through advertisements through print and other media. Premium Insurance Coverage: The annual total premium of ₹ 330/- per member will be shared as under: GOI contribution: ₹ 150/- Weavers’ contribution: ₹ 80/- LIC’s contribution: ₹ 100/- Operational Modalities: The scheme is renewable every year and continuation of coverage is ensured only on payment of premium on the due date of renewal every year. The premium amount shall be paid by the beneficiary only one-time for the whole year to the Life Insurance Corporation of India. The premium, once paid, shall not be refunded. Maximum number of renewals shall be effected each year. The insurance coverage is ordinarily effective only after receipt of the entire amount of premium i.e. both the Government’s as well as beneficiary’s share. In an unlikely situation where the Government’s share of the premium is not ready, the LIC shall accept the share of the beneficiary and affect the coverage accordingly. The office of the State Director-in-charge of Handlooms & Textiles and its subordinate offices in the field shall be the Nodal agencies for implementation of the scheme. Nodal agency will act for and on behalf of the insured members in all matters relating to the insurance cover. LIC will get in touch with State Directors In-charge of Handlooms for identification of beneficiaries, furnishing forms, instructions etc. for maximum coverage of weavers under the scheme. Release of Funds: For release of funds, LIC and the Authority In-charge of Handlooms in the State shall identify the weavers to be covered under the MGBBY. The Central Government share of the premium will be released directly to the LIC. Monitoring And Evaluation: Monitoring and evaluation of the progress of the Scheme will be done by the State Governments, which will submit quarterly physical and financial progress reports to the Development Commissioner for Handlooms.",

The scheme envisages setting up of Solar Charkha Clusters which would mean a focal village and other surrounding villages in a radius of 8 to 10 Kilometres. Further, such a cluster will have 200 to 2042 beneficiaries (spinners, weavers, stitches, and other skilled artisans). Each spinner will be given two charkhas of 10 spindles each. On average, it is considered that such a cluster will have about 1000 charkhas. A cluster with full capacity will provide direct employment to 2042 artisans. The Government of India has accorded approval to set up 50 such clusters with a budget of 550 Crores for 2018-19 and 2019-20. The Scheme is envisaged to generate direct employment of nearly one lakh persons in the approved Fifty (50) Clusters. Objectives: To ensure inclusive growth by the generation of employment, especially for women and youth, and sustainable development through solar charkha clusters in rural areas. To boost the rural economy and help in arresting migration from rural to urban areas. To leverage low-cost, innovative technologies and processes for sustenance. ( This is to inform that as per MSME directions, further Mission Solar Charkha will only be undertaken after the outcome of the Pilot projects is assessed (9 in number) and till such time no fresh proposals will be entertained. )",

Thus, 500 Solar Looms would be required to convert the yarn into the fabric at the maximum price of ₹1,10,000/- per loom and subsidy @35% at ₹38,500/- per loom and the cumulative subsidy works out to ₹1.93 crores for 500 weavers. Capital cost of construction of work shed with a minimum space of 20,000 sq. feet with 100% subsidy at the maximum rate of up to ₹1.20 crore per cluster for the SPV. Capital cost of Solar Grid of 50 KW capacity with 100% subsidy at the maximum rate upto ₹0.40 crore per cluster for the SPV. One-time Capital Cost Subsidy for the SPV @35% works out to a maximum of ₹0.75 crore per Cluster for the purchase of twisting machines, dying machines, and stitching machines (500 in number) for making the unit self-sustainable and for value addition. B. Interest subvention for Working Capital: It is proposed to have a ceiling of 8% of interest subvention on working capital irrespective of the interest rates being charged by the Banks/Financial Institutions for a period of six months. Recurring Working Capital cost for a period of six months at the rate of interest subvention of 8% works out to ₹1.584 crores for one cluster including the cost of roving, and wages of spinners and weavers. C. Capacity building: The scheme envisages courses for the spinners/weavers and others involved in the garmenting unit at a total cost of ₹ 0.595 crore per cluster for a period of two years."

Under IGNOAPS, citizens living Below Poverty Line and 60 years or above in age are eligible to apply. A monthly pension of ₹ 200 up to 79 years and ₹ 500 thereafter. The Government of India, on 15th August 1995, introduced the National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) as a fully funded Centrally Sponsored Scheme targeting the destitute, defined as any person who has little or no regular means of subsistence from his / her own source of income or through financial support from family members or other sources, to be identified by the States and UTs, with the objective of providing a basic level of financial aid. NSAP is being administered by the Ministry of Rural Development. This program is being implemented in rural areas as well as urban areas. NSAP represents a significant step towards the fulfillment of the Directive Principles of State Policy enshrined in the Constitution of India which enjoin upon the State to undertake within its means a number of welfare measures. These are intended to secure for the citizen's adequate means of livelihood, raise the standard of living, improve public health, provide free and compulsory education for children, etc. The NSAP at present includes five sub-schemes as its components - a) Indira Gandhi National Old Age Pension Scheme (IGNOAPS) b) Indira Gandhi National Widow Pension Scheme (IGNWPS) c) Indira Gandhi National Disability Pension Scheme (IGNDPS) d) National Family Benefit Scheme (NFBS) e) Annapurna Scheme Objectives of NSAP - 1. Provides social assistance benefits to poor households in the case of death, maternity, or old age of the breadwinner. 2. Ensure minimum national standards, in addition to the benefits, the States are currently providing or might provide in the future. 3. Ensure uniform social protection to the beneficiaries across the country without interruption.

The remaining premium is subsidized by the government. * For the farmers in North-Eastern States, Jammu, Kashmir, and Himachal Pradesh, the government also pays the entire premium. Comprehensive Coverage: The scheme covers natural disasters (droughts, floods), pests, and diseases. Post-harvest losses due to local risks like hailstorms and landslides are also included. Timely Compensation: PMFBY aims to process claims within two months of the harvest to ensure that farmers get the compensation quickly, preventing them from falling into debt traps. Technology-Driven Implementation: PMFBY integrates advanced technologies like satellite imaging, drones, and mobile apps for precise estimation of crop loss, ensuring accurate claim settlements. ﻿ RISKS COVERED Yield Losses (Standing Crops): The Government provides this insurance coverage for yield losses that fall under the non-preventable risks, such as Natural Fire and Lightning: Storm, Hailstorm, Tornado etc.: Flood, Inundation and Landslide; Pests/ Diseases, etc.; Drought etc. Prevented Sowing: Cases may arise where most of the farmers (insured )of notified areas may want to plant or sow. In such cases, they have to bear the expenditure for that cause and are restricted from planting or sowing insured crops because of unfavourable weather conditions. These farmers will then become eligible for the indemnity claims of up to a maximum of 25% of the sum insured. Post-harvest Losses: The Government provides for post-harvest losses on an individual farm basis. The Government offers coverage of up to 14 days (maximum) from harvesting for crops that are stored in “cut and spread” condition. It means that the Government covers farmers who have put the crops to become sun-baked in the field after harvesting that have been destroyed due to cyclone or cyclonic rains occurred across the country. Localised Calamities: The Government provides for localised calamities on an individual farm basis. Risks such as loss or damage arising from identified localised hazards, such as hailstorms, landslides, and inundation impacting separated farmlands in the notified area comes under this coverage."

High-Interest Rate: SCSS offers an interest rate of 7.4% per year. ﻿ Features : ﻿ Varying Interest Rates: The SCSS interest rate is modified once in every 3 months. Therefore, this rate of interest is subject to revision 4 times in a year. Assured Returns: The returns on this scheme are issued as it is a government-backed instrument. Moreover, contrary to market-linked investments, which are subject to fluctuations, SCSS is safe and offers assured returns to individuals. Maturity Duration: SCSS comes with a maturity period of 5 years. That said, one can extend the scheme for another 3 years by submitting a duly filled-up Form B. Nonetheless, in this regard, the interest rate as per the quarter is levied. Deposit Limit: Individuals can deposit a minimum of ₹ 1,000 to open their accounts. Moreover, one can deposit ₹ 15 lakh or the amount of retirement benefit, whichever is lower. Account Closure: Deductions are made against premature withdrawals. If closed before a period of 2 years, 1.5% deduction will be made as a penalty. Furthermore, if closed after 2 years, 1% is deducted. However, for extended accounts, one can withdraw funds post one year without attracting penalties. Quarterly Disbursals: One can expect quarterly disbursements against the deposited amount. The interest gets credited to the account on the 1st of April, July, October, and January. Nomination Option: The account holder can register a nominee to the Senior Citizens Saving Scheme. So, if the account holder passes away before maturity, the nominee will receive the due amount."
