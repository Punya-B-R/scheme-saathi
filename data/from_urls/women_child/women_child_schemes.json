The scheme envisages women's empowerment, poverty alleviation, and socio-economic inclusion of financially vulnerable women of the state through sustained financial assistance on a monthly basis so that they are assured of minimum monthly cash flow. Since substantial time has elapsed, it is essential to update information and implement the scheme with improved standards and procedures. It is necessary to phase out Orunodoi 1.0 and Orunodoi 2.0, without transferring any legacy data, to effectively launch Orunodoi 3.0. However, while selecting the beneficiaries of Orunodoi 3.0, the district administration will take utmost care that the eligible beneficiaries of Orunodoi 1.0 and Orunodoi 2.0 are not removed/deleted from the scheme whimsically, unless they now do not conform to the Orunodoi 3.0 guidelines. ﻿ The basic precondition to become a beneficiary for Orunodoi 3.0 is that the individual must be enrolled under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) as a beneficiary. For the purpose of implementation of this scheme, the definitions of household, family, income criterion, etc., will be as per extant NFSA guidelines. This new phase of Orunodoi will have the provision of automatic AADHAAR seeding of beneficiaries, a proven method for efficiently disbursing benefits to Antyodaya across the country, as in Assam, almost every NFSA beneficiary are already AADHAAR seeded. ﻿ ﻿",

      "detailed_description": "Details The “Back-to-Lab” programme of the Women Scientists Division offers Research and Post-Doctoral Fellowship to women who have a break in their career, to facilitate their re-entry in science research. The fellowship is provided normally for a period of 2 years. The scheme is open to unemployed women who are permanent residents of Kerala and qualified with PhD in Science or Engineering. The objective of the scheme is to support women having career breaks, facilitating their re-entry in scientific research by providing a Post-Doctoral Fellowship. Back-To-Lab Post-Doctoral Fellowship Programme is aimed to support women in Science in Kerala. The programme focuses on addressing the issue of the under-representation of women in higher academics and professions particularly in Science. The programme will facilitate the re-entry of women in Science after a career break necessitated due to family commitments. Active participation of more number of women in Science is socially relevant and significant, especially in a developing economy. Further, the programme would benefit qualitative interventions in Science research by effective utilization of human resource potential. Necessary conditions as per the scheme: There should be a Scientist Mentor who is a regular faculty/staff of the institution under whose guidance the researcher should carry out the work. The Scientist Mentor should have at least 5 or more years of service left in the Institution before retirement. The Scientist Mentor should constantly monitor the progress of the project, facilitate smooth implementation of the programme and ensure timely submission of financial utilization certificates by the institute to KSCSTE. Post-Doctoral Fellow availing financial assistance/stipend from other State/Central funding agencies or other sources will not be simultaneously eligible for KSCSTE Back-to-Lab Post-Doctoral Fellowship. The Post-Doctoral Fellow should furnish an undertaking to the effect that she is not availing financial assistance/stipend from any other source simultaneously. The implementing Institute should provide full infrastructural facilities such as a laboratory, computer, library, communication, accommodation, water, electricity, etc. for smooth implementation of the project. The unutilized portion of the grant (along with the interest accrued) at the end of the project period should be refunded to Council by DD in favour of Member Secretary, KSCSTE. Scientists who publish technical/ scientific papers based on the research work done under the project should acknowledge the assistance received from KSCSTE.

      "detailed_description": "Details In Kerala, a good number of women will have to undergo career breaks due to family commitments and as the gap widens, they will have limited opportunities for re-entry in Science. In order to overcome this situation and to facilitate the re-entry of women having career breaks to Science research, the Kerala State Council of Science, Technology and Environment (KSCSTE) launched the “Back-to-Lab Research Fellowship Programme” in 2010. The Scheme aims to support Women Research Scholars having career breaks, to come back to research and complete the Ph.D programme. The fellowship is provided normally for a period of 3 years. The scheme is open to unemployed women of Kerala origin qualified with a post-graduate degree in Basic or Applied Science or Professional Courses. Necessary conditions as per the scheme: There should be a Scientist Mentor (preferably a Research guide) who is a regular faculty/staff of the institution under whose guidance the woman scientist should carry out the work. The Scientist Mentor should have at least 5 or more years of service left in the Institution before retirement. The Scientist Mentor should constantly monitor the progress of the project, facilitate smooth implementation of the programme and ensure timely submission of financial utilization certificates by the institute to KSCSTE. In case the Research Fellow submits the Thesis before the scheduled tenure of the fellowship, the Thesis Submission Certificate and other completion documents should be submitted to KSCSTE within one month so as to enable termination of the Fellowship. Research fellows availing financial assistance/stipend from other State/Central funding agencies or other sources will not be simultaneously eligible for the KSCSTE Back-to-Lab Research Fellowship. The Research Fellow should furnish an undertaking to the effect that she is not availing financial assistance/stipend from any other source simultaneously. The implementing Institute should provide full infrastructural facilities such as a laboratory, computer, library, communication, accommodation, water, electricity, etc. for smooth implementation of the project. The unutilized portion of the grant (along with the interest accrued) at the end of the project period should be refunded to Council by DD in favour of Member Secretary, KSCSTE. Scientists who publish technical/ scientific papers based on the research work done under the project should acknowledge the assistance received from KSCSTE. The Research Fellow should not enter into collaboration with a foreign party (individual/ industry) without prior approval of the Council.",

It aims to provide basic primary education, nutritional support, and awareness on health and sanitation to out-of-school children from Scheduled Tribes (ST), Kathodi, and Sahariya communities in remote tribal areas. Under this scheme, free education (classes 1 st to 4 th ), nutritious meals, uniforms, and learning materials are provided to tribal children aged 6 to 12 years residing in areas where the nearest school is 1.5–2 km away. The scheme is implemented by the Tribal Area Development Project Office with community participation and employs local educated tribal youth and women. Objectives: Enroll 30 tribal children aged 6 to 12 years at each Maa-Badi Centre, giving preference to girls. Provide free breakfast and mid-day meals to enrolled children. Distribute uniforms, shoes, socks, ties, belts, and sweaters to each child. Prevent migration of children of agricultural laborers by ensuring consistent education. Involve mothers of enrolled children in food preparation on a rotational basis with honorarium. Link tribal women to adult literacy programs through Maa-Badi centres. Create awareness about government schemes on health, nutrition, and sanitation. Operate centres through local Village Development Committees with oversight from technical staff.",

This initiative actively encourages mass marriage ceremonies throughout the state. By facilitating these events, the program aims to achieve a two-fold benefit: reducing excessive spending often associated with traditional weddings and discouraging harmful social practices like child marriage and dowry. Financial aid is provided to couples to help manage the costs of their marriage. This scheme effectively promotes social reforms while offering financial support for couples across Rajasthan.",

The problems of unwed mothers are linked with various socio-economic and cultural variables. In Kerala, this problem is coupled with the ignorance and exploitation of the backward classes. It has been pointed out that there are many women in Wayanad and other districts of Kerala who are victims of social exploitation and atrocities and are often forced to become unmarried mothers. Unwed mothers have a special need for education, employment, and health care especially reproductive and child health. Quite often they are neglected from the mainstream of life. The percentage of abortion-related hazards and death is high among teenage unwed mothers. As a part of this scheme, the Government is giving ₹1000/- per month to them. One curious fact that can be noted is that the women who are exploited never blame the person who caused their misery, largely due to their style of living. At a young age, they long for love and care. Their husbands do not stay with them for long. They go in search of jobs and sometimes do not come back. Their place is taken up by someone else whom these women believe in. Therefore, their condition becomes pathetic and it becomes necessary to address their problems too.",

      "detailed_description": "Details The Union Territory of Daman & Diu and Dadra & Nagar Haveli has successfully launched the “Swabhimaan Scheme” scheme to tackle the problems of Malnutrition, Anemia, and other relevant issues. The Hon'ble Prime Minister launched the scheme in Daman on 25th February 2018 and Hon'ble Home Minister in Dadra and Nagar Haveli on 20th April 2018. Under this scheme, a take-home ration (7.5kgs nutritious) is provided every month to Pregnant Women, Lactating Mothers, and Sabla (Adolescent Category girls in the age group of 11-14 years). The nutritional status of women and children in the Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli is alarming. The UT Administration decided to wage war against undernutrition and came up with the \"Swabhimaan Scheme” as one of the potent tools. The scheme builds on the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) being implemented by the government of India. One of the components of ICDS is the provision of supplementary nutrition to children, pregnant women, lactating mothers, and adolescent girls. However, this nutrition was being provided as a cooked meal and the beneficiary had to visit the Anganwadi daily to avail of this benefit. Loss of wages or working time coupled with poor condition of Anganwadis, and poor attendance of Anganwadi workers led to low enrollment and poor uptake of supplementary nutrition. Objectives: Improve the nutritional status of pregnant women, lactating mothers, and adolescent girls Provide a monthly quota of supplementary nutrition to pregnant women, lactating mothers, and adolescent girls on a fixed day of every month as a take-home ration. Increase the number of beneficiaries availing of the scheme. Increase attendance of women in the Anganwadis where they can also avail of benefits of other schemes and be made aware of health and hygiene issues. Reduction in stunting, Premature deliveries, and low-weight babies.",

Parents of severely mentally retarded and differently-abled persons require emotional strength and flexibility. Older parents can find themselves overwhelmed by various medical, caregiving, and financial responsibilities. Physically Handicapped/Mentally Retarded (PH/MR) persons always need special care and attention since they cannot perform their day-to-day activities without someone else’s assistance. Sometimes it can be quite challenging for older parents in BPL families, especially mothers, who have to take care of household tasks and work apart from taking care of MR persons. Looking after such a Mentally challenged/PH person is expensive. These expenses can arise from medical equipment and supplies, medical care, caregiving expenses, specialized transportation, etc. Even though an amount of ₹600/- is being provided as “Aswasakiranam Pension” to caregivers (family members) of bedridden PH/MR persons, it cannot cover the expenses completely. Single mothers face tremendous challenges. Often, a custodial parent must fulfill the roles of primary provider and caregiver without the benefit of a partner.

It also provides for a subsidy on loans from the Karnataka State Women’s Development Corporations for undertaking business activities/ micro enterprises through banks and other financial institutions. Loans are disbursed through financial institutions like commercial banks, district cooperative banks, and Regional Rural Banks (RRBs). ﻿ In absence of a structured credit system, women would take loans from private borrowers and end up paying a high rate of interest. Hence, there was felt a need to have in place formal channels of credit which are accessible to women. Profitable business activities are approved and supported under this scheme. They may be bookbinding and notebooks manufacturing, chalk and crayon manufacture, jam, jelly, pickles manufacture, papad manufacture, saree, and embroidery work, printing and dyeing of clothes, and woolen weaving, amongst others. Udyogini gives adequate opportunities to such women to help them be self-employed.",

      "detailed_description": "Details The scheme \"Kanyashree Prakalpa\" by the Department of Women Development and Social Welfare and Child Development (DWD), Government of West Bengal, aims to improve the status and well-being of girls, specifically those from socio-economically disadvantaged families. Through this scheme, Conditional Cash Transfers are provided to incentivise girls to continue their education for a longer period and disincentivise early marriage. Objectives: Incentivising girls to continue in education for a longer period of time, and complete secondary, higher secondary, higher education, or equivalent in technical, vocational, or sports streams, thereby giving them a better footing in both the economic and social spheres. Disincentivising marriage until at least the age of 18, the legal age of marriage, thereby reducing the risks of early pregnancies, associated risks of maternal and child mortality, and other debilitating health conditions, including those of malnutrition. It was also decided that the Scheme should confer more than just monetary support; it should be a means of financial inclusion and a tool of empowerment for adolescent girls. The schemes' benefits are therefore paid directly to bank accounts in the girls' names, leaving the decision of utilisation of the money in their hands. To reinforce the positive impact of increased education and delayed marriages, the scheme also works to enhance the social power and self-esteem of girls through a targeted behaviour change communication strategy. The communication strategy not only builds awareness of the scheme, but includes adolescent-friendly approaches like events, competitions and Kanyashree clubs, and the endorsement of strong women figures as role models to promote social and psychological empowerment. ﻿",
