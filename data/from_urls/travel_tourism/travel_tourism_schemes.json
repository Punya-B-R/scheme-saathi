      "detailed_description": "Details Assam tea and the tea estates of Assam have enormous tourism prospects. However, the potentiality of tea tourism has remained unexplored in its actual terms. The tea gardens of Assam with their lush greenery, iconic bungalows, and the tanned ethnic people with their distinct rhythmic music and dance carry potentialities to attract both domestic and international tourist interests and can present a magnificent revenue opportunity to the state. Considering the enormous potentiality of tea tourism in Assam, it is proposed to develop 50 selective Tea Gardens as Tourism destinations in a Mission Mode approach. The development of tea tourism in Assam, besides sustaining the environment and preserving the heritage and culture, will benefit the state by creating employment opportunities and boosting the rural economy. Considering the huge potentialities of tea tourism in Assam, the Government of Assam launched the scheme “Promotion and Development of Tea Tourism Infrastructure in Assam” which broadly includes the overall experience of tourists in the midst of a tea garden or state, with accommodation facility in an iconic bungalow with modern amenities. The scope of the scheme will include trekking in the natural beauty of a lush tea garden, undertaking a tea-testing session, visiting a modern tea factory and even trying one’s hand at plucking tea leaves, etc. All components to be undertaken under the scheme will be need-based. Moreover, the probable activities under the scheme may be as follows:- a) Renovation of heritage bungalows. b) Renovation of heritage tea guest houses. c) Renovation of the front side of the tea garden depicting all modern tea tourism implications. d) Dining hall/cafeteria with all modern amenities. e) Development of swimming pool/spa as part of the facility. f) Facilities including angling, boating, water fountain, etc. g) Recreation facility/yoga center. h) Development of golf courses. i) Installation of solar lights. j) Involvement of local youths in proposed tea tourism activities to be developed. k) Facilities like tea testing shall be developed. l) Any other facility deemed fit to be incorporated for boosting tea tourism. ﻿ The assistance or sharing pattern under the scheme is 50:50 (Government’s share: Beneficiary share). The selected Tea Gardens will be the beneficiaries under the scheme, with an upper ceiling of ₹ 2 Crore as Govt. Share. Monitoring: The scheme will be implemented by Assam Tourism Development Corporation (ATDC) and monitored by State Level Committee (SLC). Fund Flow: Funds i.e. Government’s share will be released in three installments to the beneficiaries in the following manner: A. First Instalment: First installment which is 20 % of the eligible subsidy under the scheme will be released on completion of 30% of the total estimated project work based on the progress report to be submitted by the concerned Engineers of implementing agency. B. Second Instalment: Second installment which is 40 % of the eligible subsidy under the scheme will be released on completion of 70% of the total estimated project work based on the progress report to be submitted by the concerned Engineers of implementing agency.

Enhanced infrastructure not only improves the quality of life for locals but also provides a more comfortable and convenient experience for tourists. Employment Opportunities The development of tourism infrastructure and services under the Prashad Scheme creates job opportunities for local residents. These jobs span various sectors, including hospitality, tour guiding, transportation, handicrafts, and retail, providing a source of livelihood and economic empowerment for communities. Income Generation Tourism-related activities generate income for beneficiaries involved in providing goods and services to tourists. Local artisans, vendors, homestay owners, and small businesses often experience increased demand for their products and services, leading to higher incomes and improved standards of living. Preservation of Cultural Heritage Communities living near heritage sites and cultural landmarks benefit from the preservation efforts funded by the Prashad Scheme. This not only helps in maintaining their cultural identity but also provides opportunities for cultural exchange and education, as visitors learn about local traditions, customs, and history. Promotion of Local Culture and Traditions The Prashad Scheme often includes initiatives to promote local culture, art, and traditions. This may involve organizing cultural festivals, art exhibitions, and traditional performances, which not only showcase the richness of local heritage but also contribute to community pride and cohesion. Increased Tourism Revenues As tourism flourishes in areas supported by the Prashad Scheme, beneficiaries reap the benefits of increased tourism revenues. This can have a multiplier effect on the local economy, stimulating growth in ancillary sectors such as food and beverage, retail, and transportation. Skill Development and Capacity Building The Prashad Scheme may include provisions for skill development and capacity building programs targeted at local communities. These initiatives equip beneficiaries with the necessary skills and knowledge to actively participate in the tourism industry, empowering them to capitalize on tourism opportunities and contribute to sustainable development."
