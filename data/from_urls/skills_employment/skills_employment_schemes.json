AGNIPATH allows patriotic and motivated youth to serve in the Armed Forces for a period of four years. The AGNIPATH scheme has been designed to enable a youthful profile of the Armed Forces. \"Agnipath Yojana\" is a new HR Management scheme for the Armed Forces. Candidates inducted through this scheme will be called Agniveers. These Agniveers once enrolled into the Indian Air Force, will be governed under the Air Force Act 1950, for a period of four years. Endeavour will be made to enroll candidates as Agniveers from all parts of the nation, utilising contemporary technology (online STAR exam and associated testing methods), specialized rallies, and campus interviews at recognized technical institutes such as Industrial Training Institutes, NSQF, etc. Agniveers would form a distinct rank in the IAF, different from any other existing rank. As part of the enrolment process, each ‘Agniveer’ will be required to formally accept all terms and conditions of the AGNIPATH Scheme. For personnel below the age of 18 years, the enrolment form will need to be signed by the parents/guardians, in accordance with extant provisions. Post the period of four years, all Agniveers will go back to society. However, based on organizational requirements and policies promulgated by the IAF, Agniveers who have exited will be offered an opportunity to apply for enrolment in the IAF in the regular cadre. The skills gained by each Agniveer will be captured in a certificate to form part of his resume. These applications will be considered by a centralized board in a transparent manner and not more than 25% of the strength of the specific batch of original Agniveers will be enrolled in the IAF based on performance during their four-year engagement period as Agniveers. Agniveers will not have any right to be selected for further enrolment into the Armed Forces. Selection will be the exclusive jurisdiction of the Government. The enrolment as airmen into the regular cadre of Indian Air Force except for Medical tradesmen, will be available only to those personnel who have completed their engagement period as Agniveers.",

This is for the preservation and protection of the rich heritage of wood works (crafts), which is otherwise being neglected and dwindling. Objective: To empower and develop typical wood carving artisans and introduce them to the well-organized market. To create entrepreneurs and traders in the field of wood business. Important Features: To provide master craftsmanship trainers training to the traditionally expert wood carving craftsmen at 6 potential districts of Arunachal Pradesh at NID, Ahmedabad, NIFT, and Kolkata with latest technology on wood carving for product development, product finishing and linking these products to the right market. The trained Master Craftsman in turn will conduct skill development training on wood carving for the local upcoming artisans of the targeted districts, which have rich tradition of wood carving activities. ﻿",

DAY-NRLM adopts a demand-driven approach, enabling the States to formulate their own State-specific poverty reduction action plans. The blocks and districts in which all the components of DAY-NRLM would be implemented, either through the SRLMs or partner institutions or NGOs, would be the intensive blocks and districts, whereas the remaining would be non-intensive blocks and districts. National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) is a restructured version of restructuring Swarnajayanti Gram Swarojgar Yojana (SGSY). NRLM was renamed as DAY-NRLM (Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Rural Livelihoods Mission) w.e.f. March 29, 2016. ﻿ NRLM has set out with an agenda to cover 7 Crore rural poor households, across 600 districts, 6000 blocks, 2.5 lakh Gram Panchayats and 6 lakh villages in the country through self-managed Self Help Groups (SHGs) and federated institutions and support them for livelihoods collectives in a period of 8-10 years. In addition, the poor would be facilitated to achieve increased access to their rights, entitlements, and public services, diversified risk, and better social indicators of empowerment. NRLM believes in harnessing the innate capabilities of the poor and complements them with capacities (information, knowledge, skills, tools, finance, and collectivization) to participate in the growing economy of the country. ﻿ The Mission \"To reduce poverty by enabling the poor households to access gainful self-employment and skilled wage employment opportunities, resulting in appreciable improvement in their livelihoods on a sustainable basis, through building strong grassroots institutions of the poor.\" ﻿ The Core Values Inclusion of the poorest, and meaningful role to the poorest in all the processes Transparency and accountability of all processes and institutions Ownership and the key role of the poor and their institutions in all stages – planning, implementation, and, monitoring Community self-reliance and self-dependence ﻿ NRLM implementation is in a Mission Mode. This enables - (a) the shift from the present allocation-based strategy to a demand-driven strategy enabling the states to formulate their own livelihoods-based poverty reduction action plans, (b) focus on targets, outcomes, and time-bound delivery, (c) continuous capacity building, imparting requisite skills and creating linkages with livelihoods opportunities for the poor, including those emerging in the organized sector, and (d) monitoring against targets of poverty outcomes. ﻿ As NRLM follows a demand-driven strategy, the States have the flexibility to develop their livelihoods-based perspective plans and annual action plans for poverty reduction.

These farmers form groups or cooperatives to pool their resources and negotiate better prices for their goats and sheep. ﻿ Group supply is often used for the purpose of reducing costs, improving access to markets, and promoting efficient utilization of resources. The species of goats and sheep commonly found in Maharashtra include Jamunapari, Beetal, and Sirohi, among others. Group supply of goats and sheep is an important aspect of the livestock industry in Maharashtra, contributing to both the economy and food security of the region. ﻿ The group supply system has several advantages for small-scale farmers, including reduced transportation costs, improved market access, and increased bargaining power. By working together, farmers can also share knowledge and resources, such as veterinary services and animal feed. ﻿ Overall, group supply of goat and sheep is an important component of the agricultural economy in Maharashtra, supporting small-scale farmers and providing a valuable source of meat to consumers. ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿",

Goat farming is a traditional occupation of economically weaker segments of the society (small and marginal farmers, mainly nomads and landless laborer's) in Himachal Pradesh. This species is considered to be major source of economic sustenance for these categories of people. Adaptability of goats to wide range of agro climatic conditions has rendered it suitable for poor farmers. Under this scheme it has been proposed to distribute units of 11 goats (10 females +1male), 5 goats (4 females +1 male) and 3 goats (2 females +1 male) of Beetal/Sirohi/Jamanapari/White Himalayan breeds on 60% subsidy. Objectives of this scheme: Increase Income Generation: The scheme aims to enhance income generation opportunities for economically weaker sections through goat farming. Boost Meat Production: By providing high-quality goat breeds, the scheme aims to increase meat production in the state. Support Economically Disadvantaged Families: The scheme offers a 60% subsidy on goat units, making it easier for financially weaker families to start goat farming. Promote Rural Development: Encouraging goat farming contributes to the overall development of rural areas in Himachal Pradesh. Ensure Sustainable Livelihoods: The scheme provides a sustainable livelihood to small farmers and landless laborers, reducing their economic vulnerability.",

Registered Karkhanas/Karkhandars are identified who are willing to enroll a batch of trainees and ex-trainees in their Karkhana. A minimum of five trainees for a small Karkhana and a maximum of 10 trainees for a big Karkhana. A minimum of one and a maximum of five training programs per craft shall be considered for the six-month duration of the training program. ﻿ Objectives of the Scheme: 1. Revive the languishing crafts. 2. Upscale the learning techniques of trainees. 3. Improve the wage earnings of the craftsmen by leading them into collectivization 4. Create linkages with producer organizations to inculcate entrepreneurship skills and aptitude in the trainees. ﻿ Vision of the scheme: The artisans who form the backbone of the craft sector work in an exploitative chain of business leading them to a vicious cycle of poverty and pessimism. A huge number of artisans (mostly the male folk) are forced to abandon the craft activity due to low wage earnings and poor socio-economic status. It is felt that this scheme shall emerge as one of the most effective pathways to address the challenges being faced by the artisan community. Exposing the pass-out trainees to improved productivity procedures adopted by producer groups can lead them to better productivity and leverage their collective skill up-gradation which can help in promoting sustainable livelihoods as the artisans can gain direct access to customized production, new design development, technology-related modifications, and above all can have the pulse of market demands.",

Interest Subsidy: This subsidy is paid to the entrepreneur on the annual interest they pay to the Cooperative Bank. 50% of the interest is subsidised for timely repayment for a maximum period of 3 years. 40% of the interest is subsidised for all other cases for a maximum period of 3 years. ﻿ Mode of Disbursement: Bank Loan: The State-owned Cooperative Bank disburses 95% or 90% of the loan amount as Cash Credit in two installments. The first installment, which is 50% of the loan amount, is disbursed and linked to the applicant's Cash Credit Account. The second installment is disbursed after the bank receives a certificate confirming the utilization of the first installment. Subsidies: Project Subsidy: Cooperative Banks submit claims for the project subsidy to the District MSME Facilitation Centre (MFC) on a quarterly basis. The MFC then sends a requisition to the Department, which releases the total subsidy amount to the West Bengal State Cooperative Bank Limited. Interest Subsidy: The Chief Executive Officer of the West Bengal State Cooperative Bank submits a requisition for the interest subsidy on a half-yearly basis. The subsidy is then credited to the sanctioned and disbursed loan's Cash Credit account. Disbursement for both subsidies happens through the portal, which is linked to the Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS). Validity: The interest subsidy is provided for a maximum period of three years. If the bank agrees to a longer loan repayment period (e.g., 5 years), the government's interest subsidy will still be limited to 50% of the interest paid in the first three years. ﻿"

      "detailed_description": "Details The Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) launched the National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS) on 19th August 2016 to provide financial incentives to the establishments engaging apprentice under the Apprentices Act, 1961. National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme-2 (NAPS-2) aims to promote apprenticeship training in the country, by providing partial stipend support to the apprentices engaged under the Apprentice Act, 1961, undertaking capacity building of the apprenticeship ecosystem, and providing advocacy assistance to the stakeholders. It aims at improving ease of doing business by simplifying processes of apprenticeship engagement. NAPS-2 is a Central Sector Scheme (100% funded by the Central Government) and is one of the sub-components under the umbrella scheme of \" Skill India Programme ‟. The Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) is responsible for the overall regulation, management, and monitoring of NAPS-2. Objectives of the NAPS-2 scheme:- To develop skilled workforce for the economy by promotion of on-the-job experiential training. To encourage establishments to enroll apprentices by sharing partial stipend support to the apprentices. To provide up-skilling opportunities for candidates who have undergone short-term skill training offered by various Central and State Government initiatives. To encourage enrolment of apprentices in small establishments especially Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), and those located in the underserved areas such as aspirational districts and North-East Region. Anticipated outcome of the scheme:- MSDE aims to train 46 lakh apprentices from FY2022-23 to FY2025-26. The scheme envisages greater promotion of apprenticeship in India and assisting stakeholders through various measures for accelerating the performance of Approved apprenticeship. Other important key facts:- To enhance and track the conversion of apprentices to employment, apprentices, on successful completion of their training, will be provided with a provision of quick registration on the National Career Service (NCS) portal of Ministry of Labour and Employment. To boost apprenticeship engagement in the ever-growing infrastructure sector, NAPS-2 will be linked to flagship Government infrastructure programs via platforms such as Gati Shakti. Innovative models to preserve and upgrade existing apprenticeship systems in the informal economy, with a focus on craftsman, artisans, traditional skills, etc., will be taken up under NAPS-2.",

The branded (Generic) medicines are sold at significantly higher prices than their un-branded generic equivalents, though are identical in therapeutic value. Given the widespread poverty across the country, making available reasonably priced quality generic medicines in the market would benefit everyone. Objectives: To make quality generic medicines available at affordable prices to all, Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) was launched by the Department of Pharmaceuticals, Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers, Government of India in November 2008. Under the scheme, dedicated outlets known as Janaushadhi Kendras are opened to provide generic medicines at affordable prices. As of 30.11.2023, 10,000 Janaushadhi Kendras are functional nationwide. The product basket of PMBJP comprises 1965 drugs and 293 surgical items.

A proposing stakeholder can be institutions of Central or State Government(s), an autonomous body/statutory body or any other equivalent body or a corporate that wants to provide training to candidates. ﻿ The objective of Special Projects under PMKVY 3.0 (2020-21) is to undertake project-based skilling interventions, primarily to meet the skilling needs of marginalised or vulnerable groups (to mean hereafter such as Scheduled Castes and Tribes, transgender, Persons with Disabilities (PwDs), women, economically backward people, any other category which identifies as marginalised/vulnerable and is recognised by the Government of India and State Government(s) and those from difficult/remote geographies, hard to reach areas (such as Left Wing Extremist (LWE) areas, aspirational districts, J&K, Ladakh, North East states, Island territories), which may not meet all the parameters as laid down in the guidelines of Short-Term Training (STT) of PMKVY 3.0 due to special circumstances ﻿ Special Projects also envisages to cover short- term skilling initiatives undertaken by reputed industry bodies offering captive placement opportunities; projects with innovative strategies; projects offering local livelihood through creative market linked entrepreneurship, and/or projects assuring international placements ﻿ By its very intent, the projects falling under the Special Projects of PMKVY 3.0 are required to be dynamic in approach and need to go beyond the routine short-term skilling to enhance the all-round competency and adeptness of the marginalised sections of the country ﻿ The targets under Special Projects will constitute 12% in Centrally Sponsored Centrally Managed (CSCM) component of the total allocated targets under STT of PMKVY 3.0. Such projects will be approved by PMKVY 3.0 Executive CommitteeDuring PMKVY 2.0, states were also permitted to utilise 15% of their targets towards Special Projects. Similarly, in PMKVY 3.0, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) permits States to implement 15% of their STT targets as per these Special Project guidelines, within the state STT budget. Such projects will be approved at the State level by State Empowered Committee",

The scheme’s mandate is to promote and encourage young students for embracing translational research to develop innovative products and technologies addressing unmet needs. The scheme has two components: SITARE-Gandhian Young Technological Innovation Award Grant (SITARE-GYTI) and SITARE-Appreciation Grant. SITARE-Appreciation Grant: Residential workshops called as Biotech Innovation Ignition School (BIIS) for undergraduate students are organized to provide hands-on technical training and mentorship for problem identification in 3-4 weeks duration. Out of 30-40 students per workshop, 10 students are selected and provided grant support of up to INR 1 lakh each to encourage their inquisitiveness and sustained efforts. The recipients are recognized as BIRAC’s SITARE-Appreciation beneficiaries. In a year, 3 such workshops are conducted. About BIIS: The mandate of Biotech Innovation Ignition School (BIIS) is to provide exposure and orientation for the entrepreneurial journey through hands-on-technical training, interactive sessions with experts, access to a bio incubation center, etc. This is to promote grassroots innovations and nurture ideas with societal impact, pioneered by undergraduate students, especially from Tier II/III cities.

The scheme is intended for the above purpose of improving the productivity and competitiveness of the traditional OBC craftsmen ensuring quality goods for enhanced income and thereby qualitative improvement in their living conditions.

Aims/Objectives: 1. To create awareness among the skilled and semiskilled OBC workers on the need to adopt new technology in the highly technological era, for meeting the market needs. 2. To ensure sustainable self-employment for fair livelihood. 3. To ensure social justice through the overall economic development of the traditional craftsmen communities. Implementation: The Director, the Backward Communities Development Department will implement the scheme through Regional Deputy Directors of the Department.

It is aimed at upgrading the skills of the tribal youths in various traditional/modern vocations depending upon their educational qualification, present economic trends and the market potential, which would enable them to gain suitable employment or enable them to become self-employed. The scheme will be implemented for the benefit of the Scheduled Tribes as well as PTGs and can be taken up anywhere in the country but priority will be given to remote tribal areas, areas inhabited by particularly vulnerable tribes and areas affected by extremist activities. Components of the Scheme: The organization running VTC will admit the ST youth irrespective of the region/State to which they belong. It will be imperative on the part of the concerned organization (i.e. States/UTs/NGOs/other organizations) to assess the employment potential in a particular area in advance depending on the educational qualification of the target population, type of industries available in that region/State, present economic trend and market potential, etc. before proposing the trades. The organizations will establish linkages with recognized institutions which can provide a Certificate/Diploma to the candidates for the trades in which they have been trained. The institutions/organizations (State/UT run institutions as well as NGOs) who are already running projects with assistance from this Ministry, and also the new applicant institutions/organizations should get/have recognition/affiliation/accreditation under “Modular Employable Skills (MES)” from Regional Directorate of Apprenticeship Training of the State/UT Governments or recognition/affiliation under “Craftsmen Training Scheme (CTS)” from National Council of Vocational Training (NCVT) under Directorate General of Employment & Training (Ministry of Labour & Employment, Government of India), as applicable. The organization should establish linkages with placement services, and for the candidates interested in self-employment after availing the training, the organization shall arrange easy microfinance/loans for them through financial institutions, National Scheduled Tribe Finance Development Corporation (NSTFDC), banks, etc. Preference will be given to those institutions which guarantee placement/employment after completion of training. As far as possible, a minimum of 33% of seats will be reserved for tribal girl candidates. 100% grant-in-aid will be provided to the States/UTs/State-owned institutions/VOs/NGOs/other private organizations, eligible for assistance of the Scheme. The grant-in-aid will be released to the State/UT Governments/State-owned institutions in one instalment in a year, and to the NGOs/private institutions in two instalments as per General Financial Rules.",
