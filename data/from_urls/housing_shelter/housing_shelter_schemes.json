      "detailed_description": "Details The scheme “Financial Aid for Providing Hostel Facility to Transgender Students” was launched by the Department of Social Justice, Government of Kerala. Transgender share the same hopes and dreams as any other individual in our society. 58% of Transgender students drop out before completing 10th grade (24% of Transgender students drop out even before completion of 9th grade). Reasons for this include- severe harassment making studies impossible and other gender-related negative experiences at school. In order to help such school dropouts continue their education, Social Justice Department has implemented a scholarship scheme for Transgender. The transgender community is still ostracized in society and cannot take up job offers or continue their education due to a lack of accommodation facilities. Though there has been improvement in the mindset of the people, still the stigma of giving transgender persons a house exists in society. Due to this problematic scenario, transgender who are pursuing the scholarship scheme are forced to discontinue their studies. For addressing this issue, the Department of Social Justice has introduced this scheme that provides an amount of ₹4,000/- per month as financial assistance to the Transgender community as rent for finding hostel facilities/accommodation.",

The loan takeover facility is provided for the amount outstanding as on the date of application after repayment of instalments from May 2020. For employees who had availed additional loan over and above the House Building Advance amount, the Government's share of interest is restricted only to the extent of such House Building Advance loan outstanding as on the date of application. Disbursement The Government's share of interest is credited to the empanelled bank in a pool account on a monthly basis. The Government's cumulative share of all instalments due for the succeeding month is credited to the bank within a specified date, provided that the bank raises the demand at least 20 days in advance. The Government's share commences from the succeeding month of sanction wherein the employee is due for repayment of the loan, provided the demand has been raised by the bank. Duration and Validity The Government's share is continued till the employee attains superannuation or for a maximum duration of 20 years of the total repayment period, whichever is earlier, by considering the already paid instalments by the Government. If the duration of the loan ends before superannuation of the employee, the bank submits the closure letter to the concerned Government employee, Head of Department and Directorate of Accounts. Conditions The employee must ensure that his share of Equated Monthly Instalment reaches the bank within the stipulated time. Any delay on part of the employee for contributing his share, subject to a maximum default duration of two months, will make the concerned employee ineligible to avail any further benefits under this scheme. The employee must carry out all the required documentation and valuation required for compliance from the bank side, and the Government will not bear any costs for the same. The deed of mortgage or any other collateral security executed in favour of Government earlier must be transferred in favour of the empanelled bank with an undertaking from the employee that he willingly desires to transfer the same in favour of the bank. For employees who have availed benefits under the \"One Time House Building Advance Settlement Scheme\", the amount to the extent of benefits availed under that scheme would be adjusted in the initial instalments itself, till which the Government will not start contributing its share of interest and the employee has to bear the full burden of instalments. If the employee ceases to be in service for any reason other than normal retirement or superannuation or if he dies before repayment of the loan in full, the entire outstanding amount will become payable forthwith by the Government employee or his successor, as the case may be. Failure to repay the housing loan for any reason whatsoever, either by the Government employee or the successor, as the case may be, will entitle the bank to enforce the mortgage and take action to recover the outstanding housing loan. ﻿"

      "detailed_description": "Details Labour and ESI Department, Government of Odisha has introduced a scheme \" Nirman Shramik Pucca Ghar Yojana (NSPGY) \" to meet the housing needs of the building and other construction workers in rural areas, registered under the Odisha Building & Other Construction Workers Welfare Board (OB&OCWWB), who play a pivotal role in the construction of individual and community assets and do not have their own pucca house. Objective: The scheme's objective is to provide pucca houses to Building workers & other construction workers in rural areas registered under the Odisha Building Workers' Welfare Board. A pucca house means that it should be able to withstand normal wear and tear due to usage and natural forces including climatic conditions. Key Features: NSPGY is a scheme purely funded by the OB&OCVVWB with an annual budgetary outlay to be decided by the Board for each financial year, which is subject to revision from time to time. The dwelling unit under NSPGY will be sanctioned preferably in the name of the woman head of the household. No contractor shall be involved in the construction of houses under NSPGY. The fund under the scheme shall be credited to the beneficiary's account from the bank account maintained at the state level by PR & DW Department through Public Financial Management System (PFMS). No other form of payment to the beneficiaries will be made under the scheme. The minimum carpet area of the house should be 25 square meters including a hygienic cooking space and excluding toilet. The roof material will mandatorily be of RCC or any other material of equivalent strength approved by PR&DW Department. Innovation in housing typologies, design, building materials, and construction should be encouraged. Timelines: The houses under this scheme will be ordinarily completed within 12 months from the credit of 1st installment in her/his account. Beneficiaries constructing a bigger house must be advised to first complete the core house with a carpet area of at least 25 square meters and go for extension subsequently. Note: Any beneficiary allotted with a house under this scheme whose house has fully collapsed/washed away/fully damaged due to landslide/elephant menace/earthquake/flood/fire accident or cyclone, will be eligible to get another house under this scheme. The funds for this scheme will be released by the OB&OCWW Board and the execution/implementation of the scheme will be carried out by the Panchayati Raj & Drinking Water Department.",
